		<h1 style="color:brown; font-size:70px;">Welcome To My Course Page</h1>
	<p style="color:charcoal;">Here is information about all of the courses I took this past semester.</p>

		<h2 style="color:brown; font-size:60px;"> My Courses...</h2>

	<ul>
		<li> World Religions - “A study of the internal development, doctrine, and practice of the known world religions with added emphasis on the cultural, social, and ethical milieu in which the religions developed. The student will be able to compare the many movements, trends, and thoughts of ancient and contemporary religions.”</li>
				<p style="color:brown;"> In this course I was tasked with writing an essay reviewing each lecture; one for every religion covered in the class, including Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Islam, Hinduism, Jainism, Taoism, Shintoism, Paganism, Zoroastrianism, and many lesser known indigenous religions.</p>
		<li> Principles of Natural/Life Science - “A basic course designed to emphasize the nature of and interdependency of important concepts in astronomy, biology, chemistry, ecology, geology, mathematics and physics. The content will be chosen so that the methods of inquiry and the modes of understanding required by the discipline being studied become known to the student.”</li>
				<p style="color:brown;"> This course required me to review multiple broad concepts that I had been tought in high school and middle school, and served as a good prerequisite for the Life Science class.</p>
		<li> HTML5 Programming - “This course focuses on designing and coding internet web pages using HTML5. The student will develop web pages by designing, entering, and testing code using this standard (with a simple text editor) rather than by using web development tools. Topics include - HTML5 element structure, web forms, multimedia, style sheets (CSS3) to apply formatting and layout characteristics in addition to applying special effects. This course will also include an introduction to the JavaScript programming language. Students should be familiar with the basics of both word processing and Windows file management techniques before enrolling in this course.”</li> 
				<p style="color:brown;"> In this course I was introduced to the basics of multiple coding languages, mainly html and css, and was tasked with learning and memorizing different html tags and how to properly format them, and with building my own personal website from scratch.</p>
